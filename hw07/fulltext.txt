 Hey gang, there's no reason humans should exist. We're slow, we're not that

big, we don't have any sharp claws.  The only animal that shouldn't be alive

more than us is this incredibly slow, lazy beast.  I'll never understand how

these guys survive this treacherous world.  We humans need our complex brains

because it's the only tool we have to be able to survive.  But why have no other

animals developed a level of intelligence anywhere close to ours?  Surely it

would benefit a lion to be smart along with

all its other skills.  Don't call me Shirley.  Except not really, because

everything comes at a price, and that is especially true with brains.  Most

animals don't need to be smarter than they are.  You could argue that some

animals are even dumb.  Okay, okay, I'm done picking on sloths.  They're too

cute, they don't need to be smart anyway.  But all species alive today are here

because they've evolved some trait that helps them survive, like camouflage, big

teeth, or charisma.  I'm just a cool dude in a

loose mood.  None of which require any extra energy to have.  So if you don't

need something expensive like a bigger, more advanced brain, evolution likely

won't favor it, and so you won't get it.  Brains are very complex and require

tons of energy.  As far as energy to operate, the cost of primate brain tissue

scales faster than the cost of non-neural tissues.  So only our ancestors that

evolved the proper size and diet could afford to grow larger, more complex

brains,  which is why one group, us Homo

buddy, you sure you wanna keep playing?  It takes half as much energy to digest

processed food, so we get way more energy from eating processed food, which

sucks for us nowadays.  I'll have the big burger meal with a large shake.

That's your entire day's worth of calories.  Energy is way too easy to come by

nowadays.  But a million years ago, our ancestors needed all the calories they

could get.  Discovering fire and cooking

was the first form of processing food.  Our ancestors probably just thought it

tasted better, when in reality they were able to provide their brains with way

more energy, allowing them to grow much faster.  The total number of neurons in

the brain increased from about 27 billion neurons in Osteopithecus, to 62

billion neurons in Homo erectus,  and to about 86 billion neurons in

Neanderthals and modern humans.  Our brains are only half the story though.  If

we were, say, reptiles and laid eggs and didn't

care for our young, our species couldn't survive.  You're two hours old now son,

it's time to go out on your own.  A human baby would die immediately if left on

its own in the wild.  We have so much knowledge that we need to fill these big

complex brains with that it takes years of parental support before we can be

trusted to live on our own.  We also need the physical form that we have in

order to be intelligent.  Humans are one of the few groups of animals with

opposable thumbs, along with apes and

koalas.  A bird couldn't do the work of a human.  Get back to work, Stuart.  If

we didn't have these, we wouldn't be able to use tools to build things, or even

make a fire to make the tools in the first place.  So our intelligence came from

a combination of factors including diet, society, hands, and a lack of any other

way to survive.  And with a complete lack of needing to be physical and hunt and

kill our food, pretty much the only muscle we use nowadays is our brain.  We

spend all day every day for the

first couple decades of our life doing this instead of this.  Which makes it so

we're now basically bred to be even smarter with each generation.  And because

of that and the high level of technology we've already reached, our collective

intelligence is growing at an exponential rate.  But each human knows

comparatively very little because we don't need to know everything.  Since the

invention of writing 6,000 years ago, we've been able to share our knowledge

with anyone across both physical space and time.

You probably have no idea how all the many parts of your smartphone work, or

even where your poop goes after you flush the toilet.  But that's fine because

you don't need to know, you just need to be good at one thing to contribute to

society.  So we're basically now not just intelligent creatures.  Every one of

us has access to the entire human knowledge library, making every one of us

effectively as smart as 8 billion humans.  That's how we can have internet,

smartphones, rockets flying around the solar
